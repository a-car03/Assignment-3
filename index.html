          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <h3>Aaron Caridakis (s3943668)</h3>
            <p>My name is Aaron Caridakis and I am 18 years old. I graduated high school from Werribee Secondary College and now I am completing further studies at RMIT as a first year, doing the Bachelor of Information Technology (BP162). I was born in Australia and have Indonesian / Greek parents however, I can only speak English. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, watching Korean dramas and playing video games. But I have one hobby which I hold close to me, baseball. My interest in baseball began around 12 years old after my father encouraged me to play. I used to play for the Newport Baseball Club, however I stopped due to an injury. I have a natural strong interest in IT due to the enjoyment I find in playing video games with friends. I don’t have much experience working in the IT industry.</p>
            <h3>Ali Arbaboun (s3944298)</h3>
            <p>My name is Ali Arbaboun, 18 years old and I come from Iran. This is my first year at RMIT pursuing my passion for Information technology. My interest in IT comes from multiple aspects of the industry, such as the security aspect (Cyber Security), the idea of ‘ethically’ hacking, to find the weakness in code and prevent Cyber-attacks as well as Artificial intelligence. My interest in IT began when I started to volunteer at a community center to solve their IT issues when it came down to live streams. My experience in IT also developed through a year 10 excursion to an IT event that sparked my interest in IT. My hobby is playing ‘professional’ indoor soccer on the weekends.</p>
            <h3>Gabriel Arancibia (s3947953)</h3>
            <p>My name is Gabriel Arancibia (Gabe for short), and I am 19 years old. I graduated from Taylors Lakes Secondary College and am now continuing my education in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia, and I have Italian/Chilean parents, and currently trying to learn Spanish. Some of my favourite hobbies consist of reading, playing soccer, video games and music production. My interest in IT grew as I was doing a software development class, in which creating programs and designing how they function was a main part of the class and fascinated me, as also was learning about ethical hacking to safeguard people’s systems and hardware from any attacks.</p>
            <h3>Ronald Tran (s3895395)</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ronald (Ron for short) Ray Tran, Student number and email is s3895395@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia and am Vietnamese but can barely speak it. I am currently undertaking the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT due to my previous course being discontinued (Bachelor of Business Information Systems (Applied)). My favourite past time is to read Japanese and Korean fiction. </p>
            <h3>William Gardiner (s3042396)</h3>
            <p>My name is William Gardiner. I am an Australian student studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT. My education history consists of completing high school VCE in 2021. I speak English. An interesting fact about me is that I made a film last year (2021) called Clone: the film. My hobbies consist of watching anime, shows and playing games. My interest in IT stems from my enjoyment of games and VR (Virtual Reality), that is the main reason for my interest. My experience with IT is minimal but consists of using IT daily through my computer and phone.</p>
            <h3>Zaeem Furqan (s3949349)</h3>
            <p>I am a current Australian resident however I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan until the age of 12 when I moved to Australia. Education-wise I have successfully completed year 12 at Berwick College and I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. The languages I speak include English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi. Now for the interesting fact about myself: Well to sum it up-My family nearly had to go through my death when I portrayed symptoms of “Death Rattle” trying to fight Dengue Fever. My favourite sports are categorized in order as Cricket on top and basketball and soccer plus table tennis to follow.</p>

          <h2>Group Processes</h2>
          <p>Overall, the group worked to finish assignment 2 in time with each member fulling their assigned parts with some members pulling more weight. Communication was lacking with impromptu meetings and dead silence for periods of time which resulted in a late start to the assignment and some members not being on schedule. For assignment 3 our group will be holding more frequent meetings and progress checks to ensure that every member is on track. Additionally, the group has clearly designated the task and expectations that each member needs to do in order to complete assignment 3. </p>

            <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <p>Three group members have similar careers paths following the security field with 2 members being in the engineering field and one member in system administrating. Ali's ideal job is Lead Architect – Security which involves being responsible for designing, building, testing and implementing security systems within an organisation’s IT network. Similarly Gabriel and Ronald's ideal job are both connected to security being IT Security Specialist and Cyber Security Analyst respectively. Both jobs are similar with the goal of protecting people, devices, and data but Cyber security encompasses a smaller field of protecting users and systems from cyber related attacks whereas IT security does that and more where they protect against any type of computer related crime. William's ideal job is a Cloud Engineer which involves building and maintaining cloud infrastructure whereas in a completely different spectrum, Zaeem's ideal job is Machine Learning Engineer which involves machine learning engineers design and create the AI algorithms capable of learning and making predictions. The common element between these two fields of engineering is the building of complex algorithms to use for private and commercial applications whereas the previous jobs build algorithms to protect systems. Lastly Aaron's ideal job is It Systems Administrator which involves maintaining, supporting and troubleshooting computer servers and networks for organizations which is like William’s job of a cloud engineer where both need to maintain a system for an organization to use. </p>

        <h1><span>Project</span> Description</h1>
        <div class="project_content">
          <div class="project_text">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Topic</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:45px;">Everyone knows for sure that Robots are the way for a brighter future. What we propose todo in this project is to have a clear mindset/prototype and models ready that could depictwhat our Robot (Wall S) would’ve looked like if we had the proper tools and budget ofcreating and maybe even monetizing one. We are responsible for ensuring the prototypeswere turned in with an acceptable quality within the timeline. We set up guidelines andshared a style guide and checklist for helping team members to understand theexpectations. Multiple management strategies were implemented in the successful creationof this file. Risk Management consists of the identification, analysis, planning, tracking,controlling, and communication of threats to project success. All project risks should bemanaged through a formal process that includes a process to mitigate or eliminate negativeimpacts to the project, as well as develop contingency plans to lessen the impact on theschedule, scope or cost. Fortunately no major risk occurred during the production of thisreport or the prototypes. Furthermore, our main goal in this project was to perpetually see whether we as a team werecapable of even getting close to creating such an invention. These sorts of inventions areable to fetch top dollar as they are relatively new and perform wonders. Schedulemanagement was another criteria that we had hoped to work more efficiently on due tolacking this aspect in Assignment 2. Schedule management in any project is extremelyimportant as it paves the way for all members to complete their set tasks and goals on time,allowing for a better result.</p>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:45px;">The main motivation behind this however is the need to do something for people. This is a genuine and sad fact that people mostly go to hospital as a way of obtaining medicine ortreatment for their illness. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are complications ofhealthcare and linked with high morbidity and mortality. Each year, about 1 in 25 U.S.hospital patients is diagnosed with at least one infection related to hospital care alone. For those who even go to a hospital or even a medical clinic for just a regular checkup could come back contracted with the worst of bacteria/infections.Some of the most common infections people transmit across medical clinics include but are not limited to: UTI, pneumonia and even lung infections. The need to help stop this due to lack of staff or lack of care provided, I feel that UV-C robots are the perfect way to transformour hospitals in the future if we genuinely want to save lives.</p>
            <h3>Landscape</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:45px;">There are a few systems already available on the market such as the HOBOT legee 7. Various companies such as HOBOT and Kogan would be main competitors if we were to create this project on the basis of monetisation. Between our project and these readily available projects there are multiple differences. Firstly our business model is simple, instead of making obnoxiously sized and pricey robots, we would rather be making miniature models of the same project for a less costly price. Therefore, money input towards the project < total profit. So, for example, instead of ahospital purchasing a large machine to clean up a smaller surface area, they could purchase2, 3 of our smaller models to clean up the room which would not only be effective but also efficient for both the business to make money and the hospital to save money. Research suggests thatthe production cost of each robot without labour could easily cost $50+ per robot. Now if I were to produce one that's ⅓ of the size of an obnoxious one, you would estimate that my production cost would be around $15. Now those companies making their robots for $50+ are selling their product for around $600, which hospitals are hesitant to buy as the workforce per hour is cheaper. However, the aspect most hospitals do not realise is that the purchase of a robot is permanent whereas staff changes require depending. If I were to turn this idea into a business, I'd potentially look to profit at least $75 per robot, meaning sellingthe robot that cost me $15 for $100. Now think to yourself, would companies buy 1 largerobot for $600+ or 1 for $100 and add on as many as they want based on their demands. Not only this but this would speed up the process by around 50% as there could be robots working in multiple rooms at a time. Secondly, even though Kogan is already making 30$ robots, their production costs are estimated to be half of that and the quality and work radius is pathetic, something similar tobuying knockoff airpods.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <h4>Project Aim -</h4>
            <p style="font-size:16px;">- To create prototypes of an ultraviolet-disinfection robot.</p>
            <h4>Smaller Goals/Aims -</h4>
            <p>- To create a succinct report regarding our prototyping of our project idea
            <p>- To create a detailed team profile</p>
            <p>- To create an engaging and sophisticated website to present our information on</p>
            <p>- To create an appropriate jobs and skills section according to the marking rubric</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:35px;">- Provide feedback for each group member and the group itself via SparkPlus</p>
            <h4>Project Aim</h4>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 35px;">The aim of our project is to create prototypes of our ultra-violet disinfection robot. As we have limited time in creating the robot, making the robot was out of the question and as a group chose to just create prototypes using figma and sketches. This was the best option in our situation as it would be near impossible to create such sophisticated technology with little experience in such little time.  </p>
            <h4>Smaller Goals/Aims</h4>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 15px;">A smaller goal of ours was to create a succinct report regarding our prototyping of our project idea. This included everyone in the group completing their parts of the report to a sophisticated level and proofreading our report before submission. This was an important goal as the report portion of the assignment was worth 50 % of the overall mark of the assignment.  </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 15px;">The second smaller goal of our assignment was to create a detailed team profile. Though this was not one of the most important goals, it still has its place as it still holds 5 marks of the assignment. It was important to make the team profile as detailed as possible to get full marks for the team profile part of the assignment.   </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 15px;">The third smaller goal was to create an engaging and sophisticated website to present our information. This goal is aligned with the tool's parts of the rubric and would net us 5 marks if our website is exceptionally good. This was important as all marks count towards the assignment, and a website is good to display our skills in IT to potential future employers.   </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 15px;">The fourth smaller goal was to create an appropriate jobs and skills section according to the marking rubric. This section was important as it outlines the people required for us to build our robot after making the initial prototypes in figma and sketches. A substantial portion of the marks were allocated here (15 marks) so more effort must be placed on this area.   </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px; padding-bottom: 80px;">The fifth and final smaller goal was to provide feedback for each group member and the group itself via SparkPlus. This was important as in the assignment two group members did not provide feedback, so it is especially important to give feedback for each member this time around. </p>


            <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;">Autonomous vehicles will have a significant impact on society for a number of reasons, some positives include the number of vehicle accidents could be reduced and travel time can be used more effectively due to reduced traffic jams. As we continue to further develop and advance our current technologies, autonomous vehicles will likely reach a state where they will be able to have the full capabilities to drive all on their own without any type of human interaction needed with maximum safety levels. If we do reach this state, roads would overall be safer due to all vehicles being automated designed to drive safely. This will cause fewer accidents caused by human error on the roads. However, this would also impact those working in transport related sectors like car repair centers due to less accidents occurring. Overall, if this advancement comes, it should be expected to make many jobs redundant. Namely jobs such as uber would easily be replaced by autonomous vehicles causing many individuals who drive for uber to lose their jobs. However, there could also be the opportunity to open new jobs regarding the development of these autonomous vehicles. The advancement of autonomous vehicles may cause the demand for human drivers in the transportation sector to disappear. </p>

            <h3>Roles</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;">With regards to the roles we have for our project, only some members have their own specific independent role as we found Zaeem has taken on the role of being the lead developer. With this project being his idea, we feel as if it would be best for him to shape how this project will be built and point our group members in the right direction as he has an idea of what the end product of our project should look like. Furthermore, Ali would be considered as the group’s main User Interface Designer as he has already started on building a prototype of how users will interact with our product. The rest of the group members don’t have their own individual role regarding the development of the project idea. But in fact, we are going around and changing the roles and we are working on certain areas together. We thought this would be best as the majority of our group don’t yet have the skills or possess deep knowledge in some parts of developing our project. This way when we are moving on to what needs to be done next, we are able to discuss it together and contribute equally by sharing our ideas and working on the next step at hand with the help of others. </p>

            <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
            <p>Scopes that we implemented in this project included:</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">- The objective of this team was ensuring the prototypes were turned in with anacceptable quality within the timeline.
            <br>- To implement multiple management strategies to ensure all members are providingadequate and correct responses.
            <br>- The primary goal of the project will be to express our beliefs as a team and displaysome proportion of our capabilities through such project.
            <br>- Upon completion of the project, we will evaluate objectives & key performanceindicators against listed deliverables to ensure project requirements are met.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;">Limits in this project affected the project in a massive way. Initially when I set out this projectidea in assignment 2, I wasn’t aware that we as a team would choose this topic. When it waschosen, us being an ‘enthusiastic’ team we thought that we still may be able to create anactual functioning robot. Welp then we were met with multiple challenges that prevented usfrom the creation of this project and forced us to set up with just prototypes.  These problemsincluded - production cost of the robot, time shortage for both the production of the robot,production of the coding and everyday user app that would allow users to set where theywould like the robot to clean. Resources tie closely with cost constraints on any projectbecause these project requirements cost money. Without proper resource allocation, this cancause lower project quality, an increased budget, and timeline delays. This affected us a lotas we had to basically change the narrative and perspective at how we looked at this projectand how we were supposed to accomplish it. Although there may have been issues weembraced flexibility in order to effectively balance project constraints. There were timeswhen we needed to compromise on project elements in order to stay within scope. Byregularly monitoring our project plan and processes, we could control project quality. Sooverall, although it affected us deeply, we used management strategies to back ourselvesand provide for a functioning and well written report.</p>


            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;"></p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;">We as a team also worked together to coordinate testing: we addressed some bugs andissues with the design that Ali was easily able to fix. We set up meetings and usedInstagram as a way to not only test but also discuss whether the prototype meets our goalsand criteria. Formally speaking we didn’t really need to conduct user based researchmethods for our surveys. Why did we do this, you ask? Well this project is “Complicated” asdepicted by Mr Thomas Bierly, thus being the reason why it would be very hard for everydaypeople to not only understand but also the sink in the whole idea. We conducted chatsthrough Instagram where Ali, our main illustrator, was repeatedly checking up with others todepict whether his designs met all of our illustrated criteria. We were able to release theinitial version of the prototypes on time and it exceeded expectations. Beyond that, not onlydid we have a blast learning even more than we already did about A.I and robots, but alsowork together as a group to commend different ideas on what would suit a better Userinterface for both the coding app and other prototypes.</p>

            <h3>Timeframe</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;"></p>

            <h3>Risks</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom:80px;"></p>

            <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
            <p>The most critical part of any group project is the communication between group members. Having worked with different groups in the past, my experience shows that poor communication between group members sets the group up for failure. It is vital that groups detail when and where they’re going to be communicating, this could mean a meeting face to face or online on platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Zoom or even text messages. Having attended the first meeting, the end of the meeting should always be put for what is to come next. This should be outlined at each meeting with exact dates for when tasks are to be completed and submitted, ensuring that the next meetings are scheduled, and providing a timetable to the team with the exact dates of future meetings. To manage a group, especially at scale, can be a challenging job to do, taking into account when group members don’t respond. To solve the problem, the leader of the group should be notified, and a warning of deadlines must be sent to the group member not responding. If this doesn’t work, it is then that the group member’s work is to be split up with those contributing in the team.</p>
